/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * Use this file to specify configuration settings for use while developing
 * the app on your personal system: for example, this would be a good place
 * to store database or email passwords that apply only to you, and shouldn't
 * be shared with others in your organization.
 *
 * These settings take precedence over all other config files, including those
 * in the env/ subfolder.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 *		local.js is included in your .gitignore, so if you're using git
 *		as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
 *		this file won't be committed to your repository!
 *
 *		Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
 *		machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
 *		(like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
 *		of your team from commiting their local configuration changes on top of yours.
 *
 *    In a production environment, you probably want to leave this file out
 *    entirely and leave all your settings in env/production.js
 *
 *

 * http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/anatomy/myApp/config/local.js.html

     * Ports are a transport-layer concept designed to allow many different    *
     * networking applications run at the same time on a single computer.      *
     * More about ports:                                                       *

     * By default, if it's set, Sails uses the `PORT` environment variable.    *
     * Otherwise it falls back to port 1337.                                   *

     * In env/production.js, you'll probably want to change this setting       *

     * The runtime "environment" of your Sails app is either typically         *
     * 'development' or 'production'.                                          *
     *                                                                         *
     * In development, your Sails app will go out of its way to help you       *
     * (for instance you will receive more descriptive error and               *
     * debugging output)                                                       *
     *                                                                         *
     * In production, Sails configures itself (and its dependencies) to        *
     * optimize performance. You should always put your app in production mode *
     * before you deploy it to a server.  This helps ensure that your Sails    *
     * app remains stable, performant, and scalable.                           *
     *                                                                         *
     * By default, Sails sets its environment using the `NODE_ENV` environment *
     * variable.  If NODE_ENV is not set, Sails will run in the                *
     * 'development' environment.                                              *
